    # Sends a chunk in a Chunked transfer encoding stream.
    #
    #     Each chunk starts with the number of octets of the data it embeds expressed
    #     in hexadecimal followed by optional parameters (chunk extension) and a
    #     terminating CRLF (carriage return and line feed) sequence, followed by the
    #     chunk data. The chunk is terminated by CRLF. If chunk extensions are
    #     provided, the chunk size is terminated by a semicolon followed with the
    #     extension name and an optional equal sign and value
    #     (Note: chunk extensions aren't provided yet)
    #

      chunk_len_in_hex = chunk.bytesize.to_s(16)
      body = [chunk_len_in_hex, CRLF, chunk, CRLF ].join
      env.stream_send(body)
    end

    # Sends the terminating chunk in a chunked transfer encoding stream, and
    # closes the stream.
    #
    #     The last chunk is a zero-length chunk, with the chunk size coded as 0, but
    #     without any chunk data section.  The final chunk may be followed by an
    #     optional trailer of additional entity header fields that are normally
    #     delivered in the HTTP header to allow the delivery of data that can only
    #     be computed after all chunk data has been generated. The sender may
    #     indicate in a Trailer header field which additional fields it will send
    #     in the trailer after the chunks.
    #     (Note: trailer headers aren't provided yet
